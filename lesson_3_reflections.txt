When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? 

When working from another computer or when some other member is adding. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

We can choose which files/branches to update by ourselves. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instead of another? 

Fork - Copy another person's github repo to ours to make changes. - works between 2 github repos

Clone - to copy one repo to another -Between 2 local systems or from github to local sys.Branches - 
Same repo, but another version of same code, experiments , versions, etc.
